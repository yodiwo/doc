As discussed a device that implements Yodiwoâ€™s Plegma is called a Yodiwo Node. The Plegma API offers significantly powerful ways to:

-         Modelling Things and automatically presenting them to the Cyan Workflow Editor or any other Warlock API Client
-         Bidirectional event passing
-         State syncing
-         Persistent and retrievable configuration for Things
-         On-the-fly Thing generation, removal or updates from either side (cloud or nodes)
-         Sharing of Things between accounts
-         Grouping of Things; multiple Things easily deployed in IoT scenarios and configured in bulk
-         Simultaneous connections from multiple endpoints
