The goal of IoT System Integrators is to find optimal solutions for creating IoT Applications, getting data in and out of cloud platforms, executing Logic on this data which drives and affects actuators.

Hence it is important to discuss connectivity for edge devices while also providing info about how logic is executed 
For Yodiwo's Alcyone IoT platform, there are two main ways to achieve edge nodes to/from platform connectivity: (though each can be further subdivided into more options)

* via the Plegma API, via pairing Nodes to a Yodiwo account and presenting Things to Cyan directly,
* via the use of pre-existing communication-enabling blocks and API Keys tied to a Yodiwo account 

Both will be thoroughly analysed in the next sections.
